# Scene Graph Visualization 

The Scene Graph is a data structure used in modern computer video games and vector-based graphics editing applications. It represents the elements of a scene as a collection of nodes in a graph or tree structure. When an operation is performed on a parent node, it affects all child nodes.

This project provides a visual representation of these relationships on a robot using the Three.js library.
